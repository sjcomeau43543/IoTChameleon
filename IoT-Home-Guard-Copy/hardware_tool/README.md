The first version of the hardware tool uses the Raspberry Pi as a development platform. Users need to log in to the Raspberry Pi to launch the software tool through ssh, and then connect the IoT device to be tested to the Raspberry Pi wifi.

I am designing a second version, the user only needs to connect the hardware tools with a computer or mobile phone, and then it is convenient to operate.
